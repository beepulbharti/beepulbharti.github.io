Hi everyone, my name is Beepul Bharti! I am a PhD student in the [Biomedical Engineering Department][bme] at [Johns Hopkins University][jhu], where I am very fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Jeremias Sulam][js] and be affiliated with the JHU Mathematical Institute of Data Science [(MINDS)][minds] . My PhD research focuses on the statistical understanding of machine learning (ML), the interpretability and fairness of ML algorithms, and how to responsibly utilize/deploy these algorithms in high-stakes decision areas such as governance and healthcare.

Prior to my PhD, I completed my BS in Biomedical Engineering, BA in Mathematics, and minor in Chemistry from [Duke University][duke].

In my spare time, I enjoy running, playing soccer, watching basketball, and spending time with family and friends.
